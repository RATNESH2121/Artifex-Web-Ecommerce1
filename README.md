- **Database**: SQLite3 (can be replaced with PostgreSQL for production)
- **Media files** are stored in `Backend/Artifex/media/`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before deploying to production, make sure to:
> - Set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`
> - Use a strong, secret `SECRET_KEY` stored in environment variables
> - Switch to a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
> - Configure proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
